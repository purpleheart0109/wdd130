        <p>"Mosi-oa-Tunya, meaning 'The Smoke that Thunders,' is the indigenous name for Victoria Falls, a natural wonder that holds great significance for Zimbabwe. Located in the country's northwest region, this breathtaking spectacle is a testament to nature's awe-inspiring power. As the Zambezi River plunges over 100 meters into the Batoka Gorge, it creates an immense spray that can be seen from miles away, accompanied by a thunderous roar that echoes through the surrounding landscape."</p>
